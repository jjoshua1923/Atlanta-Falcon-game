# Atlanta-Falcon-game
Created a Falcons game with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This game interacts with the user by giving them chances to guess the amount of games the Atlanta Falcons will win next season. 
User will have to guess a number between 1-17. The correct guess will result in a javascript alert prompt that states “Congrats, you are correct” after entering the correct number. 
If incorrect, the user will receive the message ‘sorry, try again’. The user will have unlimited guesses to get the correct answer.
